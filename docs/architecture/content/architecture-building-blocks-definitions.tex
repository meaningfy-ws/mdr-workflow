	\subsection{Methodology}
	
	In this document we take an enterprise architecture perspective and aim to provide several architecture aspects which are necessary and sufficient to describe the publishing process. 
	
	In developing this architecture, we adopt parts of the TOGAF methodology [cite], which is a framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture. 
	
	For the architecture representation, we adopt ArchiMate language [cite], which is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains in an unambiguous way [what is archimate].
	The motivation view is developed by implementing  the following steps. First, TOGAF \& ArchiMate were chosen as frameworks. Then some interviews were conducted with the SU management, having as a goal to elicit who are the main stakeholders and their motivations. The interview notes have been distilled and organised in ArchiMate diagrams (using EnterpriseArchitect Tool for drawing the models). Finally this report was written presenting the resulting motivation structure.
