	% TODO: overview and Definitions

	\subsection{Methodology}
	
	In this document we take an enterprise architecture perspective and aim to provide several architecture aspects which are necessary and sufficient to describe the publishing process. 
	
	In developing this architecture, we adopt parts of the TOGAF \citep{togaf9.2}, which is a framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing and governing an enterprise information technology architecture. Although we do not follow this framework completely, we took inspiration from parts of it which were applicable to the goals of this architecture.  
	
	For architecture representation, we adopt ArchiMate language \citep{archimate3.1}, which is an open and independent enterprise architecture modelling language to support the description, analysis and visualisation of architecture within and across business domains in a clear and unambiguous way.
	
	%	TODO: rewrite
	The motivation view is developed by implementing a number of steps. First, TOGAF \& ArchiMate were chosen as frameworks. Then some interviews were conducted with the SU management, having as a goal to elicit who are the main stakeholders and their motivations. The interview notes have been distilled and organised in ArchiMate diagrams (using Enterprise Architect Tool \citep{ea} for visual modelling and designing). Finally this report was written presenting the resulting motivation structure.
