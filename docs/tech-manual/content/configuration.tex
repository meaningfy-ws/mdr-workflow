\section{Configuration}
\label{sec:configuration}
    
    The deployment suite of micro-services is defined docker-compose.yml file. At deployment and at runtime, the service configurations are provided through OS environment variables available in the \textit{.env} file. The role of the .env file is to enable the system administrators to easily change default configurations as necessary in the context of their environment. 
    This section describes the important configurations options available for each of the services.
	
	\subsection{RDF differ}
	
	The RDF differ application exposes an API and an UI and depends on a dedicated triple store. the RDF diff API is the core service providing the RDF diffing functionality. The URL and port are described below, as well as the request timeout:

	\end{longtable}

	Please note that the domain specified in in the URL is only available inside the Docker network and is not visible from the outside. Its purpose is to provide a named way for a service to connect to another service. 
	
	\subsection{RDF differ dedicated triple store}
	
	RDF differ depends on a Fuseki triple store to calculate and persist the diffs. The available configurations are described below.

	\subsection{RDF fingerprinter}
	
	RDF fingerprinter application exposes an API and an UI. It is based on executing SPARQL queries on given data and therefore also needs a dedicated triple store service. 

	\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}p{3.8cm}p{3cm}l@{}}

		\caption{RDF fingerprinter configuration}
		\label{tab:my-table7}\\
	\end{longtable}

	Please note that the URL is only available inside the same Docker network and is not visible from the outside. Its purpose is to provide a named way for a service to connect to another service.
	
	\subsection{RDF fingerprinter dedicated triple store}
	
	Fuseki triple store is used as the supporting triple store for this service.
	The available configurations for the Fuseki are described below. 
	
	
	\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}p{4cm}p{2.5cm}l@{}}

	\subsection{RDF validator}
	
	RDF validator application exposes an API and an UI and does not depend on any additional services as everything is encapsulated into the Docker image. The configuration options are summarised below. 
	
	\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}p{4cm}p{5cm}l@{}}
		\toprule
		Description & Value & Associated variable \\* \midrule
		\endfirsthead

		Service API port & 4010 & VALIDATOR\_API\_PORT \\* \bottomrule
		\caption{RDF validator configurations}
		\label{tab:my-table3}\\
	\end{longtable}

	Note, when validating SPARQL endpoints, the fully qualified domain name of the machine must be specified. As a consequence, ``localhost'' domain will not work as expected.

	\subsection{Nginx server}
	
	Nginx is a web server and in this context it serves on the port 80 (default HTTP) a splash page. However it can be configured in the future to operate as a reverse proxy as it may be necessary in the deployed environment. No configurations are foreseen for this service at the moment. 
	
	\subsection{Jenkins automation server}
	
	Jenkins automation server can be used to orchestrate some workflows especially those that may be triggered by operations on the SVN common repository. Only the port configurations are foreseen at the moment through environment variables. Additional ones can be done by following the official Jenkins installation manual.
