\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Standardisation Unit (SU) at the Publications Office of the European Union (OP) is engaged in a digital transformation process oriented towards semantic technologies. In \citep{costetchi2020d} is described a working definition of the architectural stance and design decisions that are to be adopted for the asset publication life-cycle process. The report describes the baseline (current) solution and the (new) target solution for the asset publication workflow that is part of the life-cycle process. 

The software components building up the target publication workflow solution have been packaged as into a suite of interconnected services.

This document describes the installation and configuration procedures along with stating the scope, and target audience.
